Description: open source intelligence automation tool
 SpiderFoot is an open source intelligence automation tool.
 .
 Its goal is to automate the process of gathering intelligence
 about a given target, which may be an IP address, domain name,
 hostname or network subnet.
 .
 SpiderFoot can be used offensively, i.e. as part of a black-box
 penetration test to gather information about the target or defensively
 to identify what information your organisation is
 freely providing for attackers to use against you.
